## Wheel Attachment Shape Optimisation

#### Genetic algorithm implementation used to find an optimal n-poly attachment shape which enables a wheel to climb up a standard staircase.

#### Run instructions:

- install packages in the requiremnts file.
- Specify cases/specs of GA run in 'ga_cases' JSON file (optional).
- run main.py from the command line.

##### Results are dynamically generated per evolved case, and are stored in the 'case_analytics' folder.
